A Payment Gateway for WooCommerce allowing you to take credit card payments using ChargeIO.

== Description ==

The [ChargeIO](https://chargeio.com/) plugin for WooCommerce allows you to accept credit card payments in a secure, PCI compliant manner without sensitive cardholder information ever passing through your servers. In order to use the Charg
eIO payment gateway, you must have a merchant account provisioned by [AffiniPay](https://affinipay.com) or [LawPay](https://lawpay.com).


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WooCommerce 2.1.0 or later

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “ChargeIO for WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

== Upgrade Notice ==

The plugin should automatically update with new features, but you could always download the new version of the plugin and manually update the same way you would manually install.
